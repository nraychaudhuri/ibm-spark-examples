5 ways to create a unique website
= - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =
internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design . this is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites . these
five points will help you come up with a one - of - a - kind design
for your website .
1 . navigation system
deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website . visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else . i would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas . look at webmasterbase
( http : / / www . webmasterbase . com ) for example . there is a list
of categories on the left , and information about the network
on the top bar .
it is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because :
- people see the top of the page first
- if you have a lot of content on one page , the navigation gets
pushed to bottom of the page . . . away from the visitor .
2 . color scheme
when you are choosing colors , make sure they contrast . for
example , do not use bright green and florescent pink . some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white .
a wonderful utility that is web - based and free is color schemer
( http : / / www . godigitalstudios . com / www / color / ) , created by aaron
epstein . many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors . try doing a search on freewarefiles
( http : / / www . freewarefiles . com ) , tucows ( http : / / www . tucows . com ) ,
or download . com ( http : / / www . download . com ) for " color schemer . "
3 . content window
this is the brain of the website . make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand .
also , provide your own original content . people do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say . they want to hear what
you want to say ! while it might be time consuming to write
your own content , it sure is worth it .
to find content for your website , try searching at
ezinearticles ( http : / / www . ezinearticles . com ) . other people may
have used the articles , but if you become good friends with the
authors , they may send you new content as they write it . be
careful though . do not use too much content from other
authors , as mentioned above .
4 . font ( s )
several types of fonts exist . the first one i will discuss is
fixed width or monospace , similar to courier or courier new .
fixed width fonts are good for displaying code ( like html . )
another type of font is called sans serif . it is similar to
arial ( windows ) or helvetica ( macintosh ) . this font can be
used for long pieces of text .
the final type of font is called serif because it has serifs ,
or curves , in each letter . often , this font is called times
( windows ) or georgia ( macintosh ) . this font , like sans serif ,
is often used for long blocks of text . it is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter , making it
easier to read .
5 . advertising
ah , everybody ' s favorite . . . advertising ! this is one of thing
that almost every website has . the most common type is what
is known as " banner " advertising . it is called that because it is
long and thin ( like a paper banner . ) how long you ask ? the
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high .
new sizes however are being used . take for example the new
style called " skyscraper " - - so called for a reason : it looks
like a skyscraper . it is tall ( about 425 pixels ) but not too
wide ( about 100 - 125 pixels . )
finding a way to place advertising can be tricky . banners
used to be placed ( and still are ) only at the top of the page .
nevertheless , banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page , at the bottom , or along the side .
conclusion
these are only five things to consider when designing a
website . there are many others however . let me know what
you find that helps you create a unique website . my email

your website is a museum with no visitors .
