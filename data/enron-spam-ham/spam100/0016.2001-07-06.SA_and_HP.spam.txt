every day of the week , i get questions from people all
over the world , including my no bs gimg members ,
wanting to know some of the most valuable " secrets "
to my on - going internet success .
let me say , above all else , i don ' t believe there are any
* true * " secrets " to success on the net . what you do to
become successful in the online world is not a " secret " ,
in my opinion . most successful people follow simple , clear ,
repeatedly - proven strategies to succeed , whether on the
net or off .
but , when it comes to someone asking for advice ,
consultation , or simply asking , " what ' s your secret ? " ,
i have to blush & say . . .
persistence and personality .
of course , i always follow the advice with my own little
disclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the
same for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over
the deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind , in
my opinion - is somehow an unknown , unattainable secret .
clearly , it is not . it ' s not unknown . it ' s not unattainable .
it ' s not years of digging to find the " secrets " to internet riches .
one thing that " gets to me " so often in my work as an
internet consultant , author and internet success
strategist is that so many people on the net seem to
have this incredibly huge mental block that stands
between themselves and success on the net . it ' s
almost as if they ' ve been barraged by so many claims
of what works and what doesn ' t work , and so many
long , complicated routes to actually succeeding in
their online venture , that " success " is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall .
it ' s not that difficult , my friends ! it is not that complicated ! !
long - time friend and business associate rick beneteau
has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking
the bank . get it ! !
http : / / www . roibot . com / bybb . cgi ? im 7517 _ bybtb .
but , the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks
so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your
online venture a success .
and , yes , rick & i come from the same school of
" self marketing " - marketing you ! obviously , that ' s
the core of his excellent new ebook , and i couldn ' t
agree with him more .
point being , * you * are everything you do online to
succeed . you are your web site , your business , your
marketing piece , your customer service , your customers '
experiences with your business - - all of it , is you !
read his ebook & you ' ll see more of what i ' m saying .
the matter at hand is that brick wall you might have
standing high as you can see , blocking the path
between you & internet success . listen to me - it is
not real ok ? it doesn ' t exist . there ' s nothing there
to fear to begin with . . . get over it ! !
what i ' m telling you is , the only thing standing between
you and the success you most desire . . . is yourself .
when you realize this , you will tear down that brick
wall by means of complete and instantaneous
disintegration . it will no longer exist * in your mind * ,
which is the only " real " place it ever was anyhow !
yes , " persistence and personality " inherently includes
honesty , integrity , accountability , and many other
qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate
goals and realize that probably the most valuable ,
powerful key to your success . . . is you !
that may be the most incredible " secret " we ever
uncover in our lifetime ! and , trust me , that brick wall
won ' t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it .
talk about simple ! !

our web site is initially designed to get leads , build
branding , and provide information . . . . . . . with a 12 month goal
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart .
we offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments
via our site .
our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in
traditional media and by referral for more information , and
to make a professional impression on someone you may not
meet before providing service .
the growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown
outside of anyone ' s expectations . . . . . . . certainly mine and
i ' ve been in this business for 25 years . the internet is not
dead in the horse business , it is just getting it ' s legs , and
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services
on - line as well . our site ( the first we ' ve developed ) has
exceeded our expectations , and we aren ' t satisfied with it
yet . . . . . . . we just wanted to get it there for information !

branding . while quality customer service and product
have been and will always be our top priority brand building
zesto is our most challenging task .
zesto . com ranks very high and most often # 1 or 2 on
all major search engines and directories even yahoo entering
the keyword zesto . the problem is simply that , who if anyone
would type the keyword zesto , therefore we must try to
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products ( citrus peel ) are used throughout
our site as well as search engine submissions .
fortunately owning a non generic domain short , easy
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because
the marketability potential is limitless .
