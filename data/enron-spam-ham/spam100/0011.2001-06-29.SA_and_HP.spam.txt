subject : using pictures as links
i ' m changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages .
but , someone told me i should still put a ' click here ' underneath all the
pictures . to me , this removes all purpose of using the pictures .
how can i get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages
without coming right out and saying so ? for example , i have a page with
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days .

- - > i am currently living in a place where the isp is
blocking 50 % of
the web . i was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by
using a proxy , but i don ' t know what that means . i am wondering is
there a way to get access to these sites ? - -
a proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses , they can be tricky to setup yourself .
i have had very good results with surfola . basically you surf to their servers and then
from there you surf through / from their servers . i have several places i surf from that
block content . surfola easily bypasses them ! its also free ! you can also make money
with them but i just use them to bypass anal retentive isp / corporate providers and
because they allow me to surf anonymously !
i have a detailed right - up on them at http : / / linkpaks . com / paidtosurf / surfola . php
see there for more info . if anything is not clear feel free to ask .

cj ,
two such sites that allows proxy surfing are :
http : / / www . anonymise . com and
http : / / www . anonymizer . com .
however , if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work .
also note , that if your isp is dictating to you which sites you may or
may not visit , then it is time to change providers !

i reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and
i don ' t like mustard yellow for a background . also in the second or third
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be " first - come " not as
shown on the page .
i feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered
on the site . i will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter .
as has been mentioned many times , some information about the person
doing the page is always good . we need some information about
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to .
~ ~ ~ ~
dennis - i took a look at your site , and have recommendations
for improving your page .
1 - i use internet explorer and view web pages with my text size set to
' smaller ' . the text you used was quite large , like a font used for a heading
for all the text . by making the text size smaller it wouldn ' t feel like
you were screaming at me . also , the background was just too much .
2 - there were spelling errors in the text . often it might be difficult for you
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time , but have a friend
look it over . spelling errors make the page look unprofessional .
3 - offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like
before they subscribe . also , if you are asking for a person to give you
their email address , you must have a privacy policy and let them know
they can unsubscribe .
4 - think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter .
it looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to .
5 - offer information about yourself , and the kinds of information your
newsletter contains . maybe extend your site to include back issues or
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past .
6 - build another page for ' sponsoring info ' and put prices on that
page . remove all pricing information from the home page .
~ ~ ~ ~
i feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text .
i also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read
quickly , and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily .
i noticed some spelling errors , and i think that a link to the classifieds
site should be provided , and online payments should be accepted .
a site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it !
~ ~ ~ ~
this is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the
message . i did not like the background colour , however that is
personal , it did not detract from the information . i was tempted
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see
a current issue . there was an error in the wording ( a word
missed ) which needs correction and i think the fonts could be
smaller . overall a non - confusing site which makes a nice change . * cheers *
~ ~ ~ ~
could use a better background and the fonts are very large , there also
are errors in the following paragraphs :
" first com - first serve " and " to place a sponsor advertisement ,
send your to my email "
~ ~ ~ ~
a single page site . it is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster ' s
newsletter to see what he ' s doing , and it doesn ' t seem to me to be
a way to get people to visit . i wouldn ' t , for example . he claims to
have lots of tidbits of information that , he says , we probably
didn ' t know , and this is possible , but in my opinion , he would be
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for
all to see - when the appetite , so to speak , if he want people to
subscribe . as it is , i would not bother .
~ ~ ~ ~
what does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo ? some useful
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy
advertisement on the net . but what we get here is a newsletter
with the owner ( whose email reads damorgarjr @ yahoo . com )
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4 - line ad .
he also tells of paid category of advertisements . this is all we get
from a site which has a grand title . even the information about
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35 - to - 40
points size which gets difficult to read .
~ ~ ~ ~
a neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on
the eyes . there is only really one problem with this page - its
just an advertisement for a newsletter . no , scratch that , its an
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter . a bold enough
move perhaps but i learned hardly anything about the newsletter
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of
ads to my email account so i didn ' t even subscribe . presumably
you ' d want to get people to sign up so might i suggest splitting
the page into the newsletter itself , perhaps a sample issue ,
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click
for more info on your free ads .
