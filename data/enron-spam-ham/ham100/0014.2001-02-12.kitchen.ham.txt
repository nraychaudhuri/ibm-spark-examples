2 : 00 pm est
beyond california : the power however , the
markets foretell stronger prices across the country in 2001 .
we continue to recommend the power producers , based on both our power price
and spark spread analyses , which show strengthening spark spreads in the
united states , despite the record highs recently seen in the natural gas
markets . we highlight calpine , nrg energy , and mirant .
our volatility indices demonstrate a dramatic shift in historical volatility
to the western hubs and away from the midwestern markets of 1998 - 99 . we
expect volatility to persist in the west , likely accompanied by higher
volatility in the remainder of the country in 2001 . this benefits energy
merchants , and we highlight enron , dynegy , duke , and el paso .
