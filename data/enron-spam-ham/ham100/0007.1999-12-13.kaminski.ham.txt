work with you and them soon . i am writing to let you know that i would
be very happy to work at enron over my break and i would like to plan
out a schedule .

before christmas . i will be available the following three weeks , from
monday , dec . 27 to friday , jan . 14 . please let me know if during those
three weeks , you would like me to work and for what dates you would need
the most help so that we can arrange a schedule that would be most
helpful to you and so that i can contact andrea at prostaff soon .
