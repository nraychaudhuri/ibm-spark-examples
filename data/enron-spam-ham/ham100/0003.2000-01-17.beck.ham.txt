two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point
and three of you were not in attendance , so i wanted to send you the attached
memo that i distributed at the end of the meeting . this memo will be sent by
rick causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that i will assume
with regard to global operations . i shared this in the staff meeting so that
you would be the first to know . i will still fulfill my role within ena as
vp of energy operations . i will not be going away ! this expanded
responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel
and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the
organization .
