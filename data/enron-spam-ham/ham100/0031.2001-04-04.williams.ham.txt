Subject: re : weights ? nice .
hey . i saw this sunrise from my place this morning . granted it didn ' t look as cool as it probably did from up here , but it was pretty sweet . it was so orange and pinkish . i wasn ' t here too late last night which ruled . yeah , i went to bally ' s and did the cross country machine and the stairmaster . funny . i look like such a retard on those machines , but anyways . i guess that place it ok , but i just feel really self - conscious when i am there . at the enron gym in houston i just felt more at ease or something . i wanted to go into the free weight area to do some lunges and tricep work last night , but the meatheads scared me off . it was pretty lame i admit , but what can i say ? anyhoo , coffee sounds good to me as it usually does . let me know when is good for you ( maybe 9 ish ) .
