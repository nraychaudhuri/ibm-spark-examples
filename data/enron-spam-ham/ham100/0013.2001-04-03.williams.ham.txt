good morning . i ' m glad to hear that you are having a better day today . me , too so far . yeah , i stayed last night until like 7 : 45 and finished up that stuff with mike etringer . so today should be a bit more chill for me which is awesome . anyhow , i hope nothing blows up over there for you . maybe we can go to get some coffee later or something . did you end up going out last night for some beers ? i watched alli mcbeal and ate dinner . it was pretty exciting .
