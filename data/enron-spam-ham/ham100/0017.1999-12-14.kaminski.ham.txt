Subject: a paper of mine
vince ,
i have written a paper , which supposedly is going to be published in the
february 2000 issue of eprm , probably after some editorial cuts ( at least
this is what i am being told by them ) . i would appreciate your thoughts if
you would have time to read it .
regards ,
